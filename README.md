# Overview

The purpose of creating this app was to learn how to make an app using the Kotlin knowledge I have learned. The app I decided to make was a dice rolling app with help from the Google Android Developer website.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio for my IDE.

I used Kotlin to program the backend part of the app. The libraries I used were imported automatically with Android Studio.
